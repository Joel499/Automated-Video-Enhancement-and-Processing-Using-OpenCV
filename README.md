---STEPS AND GUIDELINES TO RUN CODE---

1) Ensure all files reside within the same folder
2) Effects take place 5 seconds after the main video starts and end 3 seconds before the main video ends
3) A temporary endscreen file 'temp_endscreen' will be created for videos that don't match the main video fps with similar resolutions 
4) Videos are arranged from 'street.mp4', 'office.mp4', 'traffic.mp4', 'singapore.mp4' to be processed respectively
